The text of the homework is:<br>
<<Client:
•Readsaddressand port numberof the server service from commandline
•Readstwonumbersfrom standard input and sendsthemto the server
•Receivesand printsthe response from the server•

Server:
•Readsthe port numberof the service from commandline
•Printsaddressand port numberof the connectingclients
•Receives two integers from each client, computes the sum and sends back the response with the result

•You haveto handle the possible exceptions
•Develop both an iterative and a multi-threaded version of the server>>
