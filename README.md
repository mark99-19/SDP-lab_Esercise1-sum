The text of the homework is:<br>
<<Client:<br>
•Reads address and port number of the server service from command line<br>
•Reads two numbers from standard input and sends them to the server<br>
•Receives and prints the response from the server<br>
<br><br>
Server:<br>
•Reads the port number of the service from command line<br>
•Prints address and port number of the connecting clients<br>
•Receives two integers from each client, computes the sum and sends back the response with the result<br><br>

•You haveto handle the possible exceptions<br>
•Develop both an iterative and a multi-threaded version of the server>>
